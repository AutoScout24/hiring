# AutoScout24 is Hiring!

Hi There,

Our company AutoScout24 GmbH (http://www.autoscout24.com/) is searching for a Senior Engineer with relocation to Munich,
Germany.

Short summary of our stack: `Scala`, `JS` (`VanillaJS` - if you know what I mean ;)), `SCSS`, `Play` Framework, `Akka` [Actors, Streams, Http], `Elasticsearch`,
`Kafka`, `Apache Spark`, `AWS`, Agile environment, microservices.

AutoScout24 is Europe's largest online car advertisement portal. Since the last couple of years our development teams are
working on slicing our legacy monolith, a `.Net` application, to microservices using `Scala` and moving all infrastructure
into the cloud powered by Amazon Web Services (`AWS`). We are also working on a fully reimplementation of our frontend part, keeping ”Mobile first” in mind. You can read more about our move in our blog:

A great thing about AutoScout24 is that the business is what demands these changes and the use of up-to-date technologies. So we as part of IT do not need to beg business for giving us time for refactorings or stabilisation, since it is fully in our competence and in the business interests to do so. With that in mind, it is still our main focous to keep the business values in mind in all that we are doing.

In IT we defined a set of solid principles that guide us through our day-to-day business. Principles like “you build it, you run
it”, “collaboration culture”, “autonomous teams”, “infrastructure as a code” and others that helps us in our development.
You can find more about our principles in our GitHub repository (feel free to open PDF files to have formatted text):

Also here is a video (YouTube) of our architect [Christian Deger](https://twitter.com/cdeger) who explains about our
principles, culture and why we are doing it [picture ↓ is clickable]:

Our teams are cross-functional, we do not divide engineers on backend, frontend, QA or Ops. It is OK to be deeply
specialised in one field, but you should be ready to work in any area.

On the backend side we mainly use `Scala` but we also have some `Ruby` and `Bash` scripts, or `NodeJS` for `AWS` Lambdas
(currently most of them written in `Scala` too). We build microservices by the principle of “Share nothing” to achieve
as much autonomy as possible. Our teams use `Play` Framework and the `Akka` stack with Actors, Streams, Http. To achieve
high availability, performance and scalability of our services and for using the best practices we consult and work
directly with consultants from Lightbend (ex Typesafe), [Codecentric](https://github.com/Codecentric) and [ThoughtWorks](https://github.com/ThoughtWorks).

Our frontend is built with the principle of “Mobile first” in mind (Mobile Web). We do responsive design with help
of `SCSS` and we care about page load. We try to minimize external `JS` libraries and prefer pure `JS` (`Vanilla JS` ;)).

You as a team member are responsible for code quality and for covering this code with tests. Of course you should feel free to use knowledge and experience from our QA engineers. So, do not write bad code, write good code! ;)

Candidate should not be scared of working with the command line. We are using the concept "You build it, you run it", so the team is responsible for owning microservices in `AWS`, therefore you should be ready to fix problems during "on call" duty. We as a team are responsible for implementing all the necessary monitoring \ alerting tools, to be aware of what's going on with our microservices on production.

You should be open to do a lot of (self-) education and be open to learn new stuff, since the company provides a lot of
trainings and is interested in getting each employee smarter and better in what he/she do. Also it is a part of our
company culture. All IT people in AutoScout24 is passionate about technology. Almost every week there are 1-3 workshops
from employees, where someone explains or shows the cool stuff he/she did, implemented or discovered.

So if all of this sounds interesting for you we would be happy to receive your CV. Feel free to contact one of our
colleagues [picture ↓ is clickable]:
