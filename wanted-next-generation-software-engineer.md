# AutoScout24 is Hiring!

Hi There,

Our company AutoScout24 GmbH (http://www.autoscout24.com/) is searching for Senior Engineer with relocation to Munich,
Germany.

Short summary of our stack: `Scala`, `JS` (`VanillaJS` - if you know what I mean ;)), `SCSS`, `Play` Framework, `Akka` [Actors, Streams, Http], `Elasticsearch`,
`Kafka`, `Apache Spark`, `AWS`, Agile environment, microservices.

AutoScout24 is Europe's largest online car advertisement portal. Since last couple of years our development teams are
working on slicing legacy monolith `.Net` application to microservices using `Scala` and moving all infrastructure
into the cloud powered by Amazon Web Services (`AWS`). We are also working on a fully reimplementation of our frontend part
with a thought of ”Mobile first”. More about our move you can read in our blog:

Nice thing about AutoScout24 is that it is the business who demands changes and the use of up-to-date technologies. So we as part of
IT do not need to beg business for allowing us time for refactoring or stabilisation, it is fully in our competence
and the business interests to do so. But still we should be focused and keep the business values in mind in all that we are
doing.

In IT we defined solid principles that guide us through our day-to-day business. Principles like “you build it, you run
it”, “collaboration culture”, “autonomous teams”, “infrastructure as a code” and others that helps us in our development.
You can find more about our principles in our GitHub repository (feel free to open PDF files to have formatted text):

Also here is a video (YouTube) of our architect [Christian Deger](https://twitter.com/cdeger) who explains about our
principles, culture and why we are doing it [picture ↓ is clickable]:

Our teams are cross-functionals, we do not divide engineers on backend, frontend, QA or Ops. It is OK to be deeply
specialised in one of the fields, but you should be ready to work in any area.

On backend part we mainly use `Scala` but we also have some `Ruby` and `Bash` scripts, or `NodeJS` for `AWS` Lambda
(currently most of them written in `Scala` too). We build microservices by the principle of “Share nothing” to achieve
as much autonomy as possible. Our teams use `Play` Framework and `Akka` stack with Actors, Streams, Http. To achieve
high availability, performance and scalability of our services and for use of the best practices we consult and work
directly with Lightbend (ex Typesafe), [Codecentric](https://github.com/Codecentric) and [ThoughtWorks](https://github.com/ThoughtWorks) guys.

Our frontend is built with the principle of “Mobile first” in mind (Mobile Web). We do responsive design with help
of `SCSS` and we care about page load. We try to minimize external `JS` libraries and prefer pure `JS` (`Vanilla JS` ;)).

You as a team member is responsible for your code quality and for the tests that you covered your code. Of course
feel free to use knowledge and experience of the QA guys. So, do not write bad code, write good code! ;)

Candidate should not be scared of working with console. We using the concept "You build it, you run it", so the team is
responsible for own microservices in `AWS` and you should be ready to fix problems during "on call" duty. We as a team
are responsible for implement all necessary monitoring \ alert tools to be aware of whats going on with our microservices
on production.

You should be open to do a lot of (self-) education and be open to learn new stuff, since the company provides a lot of
trainings and is interested in that each employee get smarter and better in what he/she do. Also it is a part of our
company culture. All IT people in AutoScout is passionate about technologies. Almost every week there are 1-3 workshops
from employees, where someone is explaining or showing what cool stuff he/she did, implemented or discovered.

So if all of this sounds interesting for you we would be happy to receive your CV. Feel free to contact one of our
colleagues [picture ↓ is clickable]:
