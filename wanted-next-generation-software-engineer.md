AutoScout24 is Europe's largest online car advertisement portal. For the last couple of years our development teams have been working on slicing up our legacy monolith `.NET` application into microservices. We are using `Scala` and moving all infrastructure into the cloud powered by Amazon Web Services (`AWS`). We are also working on a full reimplementation of our frontend, with the aim of being ”Mobile first”. You can read more about our move in our blog:

AutoScout24 is a business that demands change and the use of up-to-date technologies. Our engineering group do not need to beg the business to allow us the time for refactoring or stabilisation. It is fully in our control and in the business's interests to do so. However, it is important that we are focused and keep the business values in mind in everything that we do.

We defined a set of solid principles that guide us through our day-to-day business. Principles like “you build it, you run
it”, “collaboration culture”, “autonomous teams”, “infrastructure as a code” and others help guide our development.
You can find more about our principles in our GitHub repository (feel free to open PDF files to have formatted text):

Feel free to visit the [Microservices Meetup in Munich](http://www.meetup.com/Microservices-Meetup-Munich/) organised by Christian. We are trying to invite interesting speakers from all over the world, we are proud to say that for last couple of years our speakers were: Stefan Tilkov, James Lewis, Sam Newman, Phil Calçado, Eberhard Wolff, Uwe Friedrichsen,
Chris Richardson, Adrian Cockcroft, Gregor Hohpe.

You can also watch videos from the Microservices Meetup on our YouTube Channel [picture ↓ is clickable]:

Our teams are cross-functional. We do not divide engineers on backend, frontend, QA or Ops. It is OK to be deeply specialised in one of the fields, but you should be ready to work in any area.

For our backends we generally use `Scala` but we also use `Ruby` and `Bash` scripts for deployment. When working with `AWS` Lambda we mostly use `Scala` but we also use `NodeJS`. We build microservices with the principle of “Share nothing” to achieve as much autonomy as possible. Our teams use the `Play` Framework and `Akka` stack with Actors, Streams and Http. To achieve high availability, performance and scalability of our services and to use best practices we consult and work directly with Lightbend (ex Typesafe), [Codecentric](https://www.codecentric.de/) and [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com).

Our frontend is built with the principle of “Mobile first” in mind (Mobile Web). We do responsive design with help
of `SCSS` and we care about page load. We try to minimize external `JS` libraries and prefer pure `JS` (`Vanilla JS`).

Feel free to check out some of our Open Sourced frontend libraries:

- https://gitlab.com/web-experience/showcar-ui

Also our Web Experience team built Bootstrap library with AutoScout24 styles: https://web-experience.gitlab.io/showcar-ui/

You as a team member are responsible for code quality and for covering your code with tests. Of course you should feel free to use knowledge and experience from our QA engineers. So, do not write bad code, write good code! ;)

Candidate should not be scared of working with the command line. We are using the concept "You build it, you run it", so the team is responsible for owning microservices in `AWS`, therefore you should be ready to fix problems during "on call" duty. Each team is responsible for implementing all the monitoring and alerting tools necessary to be aware of what's going on with their microservices on production.

If you would like to know more about why we chose `AWS` and how it works for us, you can read it in our Amazon Web Services Case Study (article in German)[picture ↓ is clickable]:

[![AWS Case Study](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1098414/17675782/870152ea-632b-11e6-8bd6-9e78b409e341.png)](https://aws.amazon.com/de/solutions/case-studies/autoscout24/)

You should be open to do a lot of (self-) education and be open to learning new things. AutoScout24 provides a lot of training and is invested in each employee to become smarter and better in what they do. This is an integral part of our company culture. All of the IT people at AutoScout24 are passionate about technology. Almost every week there are 1-3 workshops from employees, where someone is explaining or showing what cool stuff they did, implemented or discovered.

So if all of this sounds interesting for you we would be happy to receive your CV. Feel free to contact one of our
colleagues [picture ↓ is clickable]:
